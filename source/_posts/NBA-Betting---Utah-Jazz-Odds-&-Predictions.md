#  NBA Betting - Utah Jazz Odds & Predictions

The Utah Jazz are a professional basketball team in the National Basketball Association (NBA). The team is based in Salt Lake City, Utah. The Jazz play their home games at Vivint Smart Home Arena. The team was founded in 1974 as the New Orleans Jazz. The Jazz have won two conference championships and ten division titles.

The Utah Jazz finished the 2017-18 season with a 48-34 record, good for 5th place in the Western Conference. They were eliminated by the Oklahoma City Thunder in the first round of the playoffs. Donovan Mitchell was named Rookie of the Year and Rudy Gobert was named Defensive Player of the Year.

The Utah Jazz offseason has been eventful so far. They acquired point guard Mike Conley from the Memphis Grizzlies and small forward Bojan Bogdanovic from the Indiana Pacers. They also re-signed shooting guard Rodney Hood and power forward Derrick Favors.

The Utah Jazz odds to win the NBA Championship are 80/1 according to Sportsbook Review.

The following are Sportsbook Review's odds for the outcome of the 2018-19 Utah Jazz season:

Odds to Win Western Conference - 10/1 
Odds to Win NBA Championship - 80/1

#  What Does Modney Mean When Sports Betting Utah Jazz?

There are a lot of NBA teams that are overlooked by the casual fan. One such team is the Utah Jazz. The Jazz play in a small market and typically do not have the star power of some of the larger franchises. However, this does not mean that they cannot be contenders.

The Jazz finished the 2017-2018 season with a 48-34 record. This was good enough for the fifth seed in the Western Conference and a trip to the playoffs. They were ultimately defeated by the Houston Rockets in five games, but they showed that they are a team to be reckoned with.

One player who has been a big part of the Jazz's success is Rudy Gobert. Gobert is a 7'1" center who is an outstanding defender and rebounder. He was named to the All-NBA Second Team last season and should only continue to improve.

Another player who is important to the Jazz is Gordon Hayward. Hayward was an All-Star in 2016-2017 before leaving Utah to sign with the Boston Celtics as a free agent. Hayward missed almost all of last season with an ankle injury, but he is expected to return this year and make an impact.

The Jazz also have some other talented players, such as Donovan Mitchell and Joe Ingles. Mitchell had a breakout rookie season last year and could become even better this year. Ingles is one of the best shooters in the NBA and is also very underrated defensively.

The Jazz will be looking to build off of their playoff run from last year and become an even more formidable opponent this season. They should not be underestimated, especially now that Gordon Hayward is back healthy.

#  Utah Jazz: Betting The Underdog



Utah Jazz fans have had a lot to be excited about this offseason. The team has made moves to improve on their 51-31 record from a year ago. First, they re-signed center Rudy Gobert to a four-year, $102 million contract. They also acquired shooting guard Ricky Rubio from the Minnesota Timberwolves and small forward Thabo Sefolosha from the Atlanta Hawks.

The Jazz are hoping these additions will help them compete in the powerful Western Conference. However, there are some who believe that the team may be overrated and that their record from last season was a result of playing in a weak division.

As of now, the Jazz are listed as +1100 underdogs to win the NBA championship. This means that if you bet $100 on them, you would win $1,100 if they were to win it all. There is definitely value in betting on this team at these odds.

In addition to being underdogs for the championship, the Jazz are also underdogs for the Western Conference title. They are currently listed at +2000 to win it all, which again is good value.

There are some concerns with this team, however. For one, they have never been past the second round of the playoffs and may not be able to compete with teams like the Golden State Warriors and San Antonio Spurs. Additionally, they lost shooting guard Gordon Hayward in free agency and he will be tough to replace.

Despite these concerns, I believe that the Utah Jazz are worth betting on this season. With Gobert anchoring their defense and Rubio and Sefolosha adding depth to their roster, they should be able to compete against anyone in the West. I would recommend betting on them at +2000 or higher to win the Western Conference title this season.

#  Jazz vs Pacers Point Spread: NBA Playoffs Series Odds

The Jazz have the No. 5 seed in the Western Conference and will face the Pacers in the first round of the NBA playoffs. The Pacers finished as the No. 4 seed in the Eastern Conference.

The Jazz are a -2.5 point favorite in this series, with a potential total of 197 points. The Jazz closed out the season with a 47-35 record, while the Pacers finished with a 48-34 record.

The Pacers were one of the hottest teams in the NBA over the last few months of the season, but they will be facing a tough opponent in the Jazz. Utah is led by Donovan Mitchell, Rudy Gobert, and Ricky Rubio.

Mitchell was one of the breakout stars of last year’s NBA draft and has been even better in his second year in the league. He averaged 21 points per game during the regular season and will be looking to lead Utah on a deep playoff run.

Gobert is one of the best defenders in the NBA and anchors Utah’s defense. He averaged 13 points, 10 rebounds, and 2 blocks per game during the regular season and will be a matchup nightmare for Indiana’s frontcourt.

Rubio has had an up-and-down career but has been playing some of his best basketball over the past few seasons. He averaged 14 points and 7 assists per game this season and will be looking to make an impact against Indiana’s guards.

The Pacers are led by Victor Oladipo, who had an MVP-caliber season this year. Oladipo averaged 23 points per game during the regular season and is coming off back-to-back All-Star appearances.

Aside from Oladipo, Indiana doesn’t have many other players who can score consistently. Myles Turner is their best big man, but he doesn’t have much playoff experience. Darren Collison is their starting point guard, but he is more of a floor general than a scorer.

The Jazz are clearly favored in this series, but don’t count out Indiana just yet. They have played well over the past few months and have a superstar player in Oladipo who can take over a game at any moment.

#  Jazz Heading Into Playoffs As Underdog

The Jazz head into the playoffs as the underdog, but they should not be underestimated. Led by Donovan Mitchell, they have proven they can compete with anyone.

Utah is coming off a 97-92 victory over the Oklahoma City Thunder on Sunday. Mitchell led the way with 27 points and 10 rebounds. Ricky Rubio also had a big game, scoring 21 points and dishing out 10 assists.

The Jazz will face the Houston Rockets in the first round of the playoffs. The Rockets are one of the best teams in the NBA, but Utah has shown that they can compete with anyone. They have already beaten Houston three times this season.

Mitchell has been a breakout star for the Jazz this season. He was selected as a finalist for Rookie of the Year, and he is definitely a player to watch in these playoffs. He is averaging 20.5 points per game this season.

The Jazz are a young team, but they have proved that they can compete against anyone. They will be looking to make some noise in these playoffs and maybe even make it to the Western Conference Finals.
