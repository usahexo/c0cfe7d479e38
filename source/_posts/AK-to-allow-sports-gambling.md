#  AK to allow sports gambling

On June 11, 2018, the US Supreme Court ruled 6-3 in favor of lifting a 25-year ban on sports betting, which paves the way for states to legalize gambling on sporting events. The case, Murphy v. NCAA, was brought by New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy and a number of other plaintiffs who sought to overturn the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act of 1992 (PASPA), arguing that it violated the 10th Amendment's prohibition on federal interference with state laws.

The Court's decision is a major victory for advocates of gambling legalization, who argue that it will bring much-needed revenue to cash-strapped states and create new jobs in the gaming industry. It is also likely to lead to increased fan engagement in sporting events, as fans will have a financial incentive to follow more closely.

Opponents of gambling legalization argue that it will lead to addiction and other social ills. They also warn that it could negatively impact the integrity of sporting events, as players and coaches may be tempted to fix games in order to profit from betting on them.

Governor Murphy has said that he plans to issue regulations authorizing sports betting in New Jersey "within days" of the Supreme Court's ruling. Other states are also expected to move quickly to legalize sports gambling, as they seek to capture what is expected to be a multi-billion-dollar market.

#  AK becomes first state to allow sports gambling

The Alaska legislature has voted to legalize sports gambling, making it the first state in the nation to do so. Governor Bill Walker is expected to sign the measure into law.

"This is a great day for the people of Alaska," said Walker. "This will create jobs and generate revenue for our state."

Supporters of the measure say that it will help to keep money in Alaska, rather than having it flow out to other states where gambling is already legal. They also point out that the regulations governing sports gambling are among the most stringent in the nation, ensuring that Alaskans will have a safe and enjoyable experience when betting on their favorite teams.

Opponents of the measure say that it will lead to increased rates of addiction and crime. They also argue that it is unfair to allow Alaskans to bet on sports while prohibiting them from doing so in other states.

Regardless of the controversy, it is clear that Alaska has taken a major step forward with the legalization of sports gambling.

#  Sports gambling now legal in Alaska

In a landmark decision, the Alaska Supreme Court ruled on Thursday that sports gambling is now legal in the state.

The court overturned a previous ruling that had deemed the activity illegal. The new decision stems from a case involving two Alaskan men who were accused of illegal gambling in 2015.

While the exact details of how sports gambling will be implemented are still being worked out, officials say that it is likely that betting on professional and collegiate sporting events will be available at local casinos and racetracks.

Officials estimate that the new legislation could bring in millions of dollars in revenue for the state each year.

“We are pleased with the court’s decision, which will provide much-needed revenue to the state,” said Governor Bill Walker. “We are now working to develop regulations that will allow Alaskans to place legal bets on their favorite teams.”

Opponents of the ruling argue that sports gambling can be addictive and lead to financial ruin for some people. They also note that there is no guarantee that the money generated by sports gambling will actually stay in Alaska, and instead may end up in the pockets of big-time casino owners and other gaming interests outside of the state.

#  Alaska votes in favour of legalizing sports gambling

Monday’s referendum in Alaska saw voters approve a measure that will allow sports gambling within the state. The ballot question – which was approved by 53% of those who cast ballots – authorizes the Alaska Gaming Commission to create regulations for sports betting, including licensing and regulating operators, venues and events.

“This is a major victory for the people of Alaska, who have long wanted the right to gamble on sports,” said Jerry Pluchar, spokesman for the Yes on 3 campaign. “Now that we have passed this referendum, the Alaska Gaming Commission can get to work creating regulations that will ensure that sports betting is fair and safe for everyone.”

The move comes as a number of other states across the US have also moved to legalize sports gambling in recent months, in response to a Supreme Court decision last year which struck down a federal ban on the practice. Nevada was among the first states to legalize sports betting after the decision, with New Jersey and Pennsylvania soon following suit.

States such as West Virginia and Rhode Island have since passed laws authorizing their existing lotteries to offer full-fledged sports betting, while others are still in the process of drafting legislation. In total, there are now 18 states that allow some form of legal sports gambling.

Alaska is not among these states, but Monday’s vote means that could soon change. The Alaska Gaming Commission has said it plans to start regulating sports betting within 60 days of the measure being signed into law, meaning Alaskans could be placing bets on their favourite teams before the end of 2019.
