#  Resort Casino in Stateline Adds 10% Surcharge for Basic Blackjack Strategy Chart

In what is seen as a stinging rebuke to basic blackjack strategy, the management at the Resort Casino in Stateline has announced that they will be adding a 10% surcharge for players who insist on using a chart.

According to casino spokesperson Jason Collins, the new policy is designed to discourage players from using basic strategy and therefore make the game more challenging and fun.

“We feel that this move will add an extra level of excitement to the game and make it more rewarding for those who are willing to take some risks,” said Collins.

The reaction from blackjack experts was swift and scathing.

“This is nothing more than blatant price gouging,” said one expert. “By imposing this surcharge, the casino is essentially saying that it’s not interested in players who want to play by the rules.”

Another expert went even further, calling the Resort Casino in Stateline “the worst blackjack venue in the country.”

#  Harveys Adds 10% Surcharge for Basic Blackjack Strategy Chart

Basic blackjack strategy dictates when to hit, stand or double down. In the hope of minimizing the house edge, many players use charts to follow basic blackjack strategy. Harveys Casino has responded to this by adding a 10% surcharge for anyone using a basic blackjack strategy chart.

The casino’s Director of Marketing, Julie Swann, had this to say about the new policy:

“We are simply trying to recoup some of the money we lose due to players using basic blackjack strategy charts. We understand that people may not be happy about this, but at the end of the day it is our casino and we can make these rules if we want to.”

When asked what he thought about Harveys’ new policy, one local player said:

“I don’t really care. I know how to play blackjack and I don’t need no chart telling me what to do. If Harveys wants to make a few extra bucks by making their customers use basic strategy, that’s on them. I plan on continuing to play how I want and hopefully come out ahead.”

Other players have voiced similar sentiments, with none seeming particularly concerned about the 10% surcharge. Whether this will have any impact on business at Harveys Casino remains to be seen.

#  Resort Casino Stateline to Add 10% Surcharge for Basic Blackjack Strategy Chart

A spokesperson for Resort Casino Stateline has announced that the casino will be levying a 10% surcharge on all Blackjack hands played using the basic strategy chart.

This follows a recent study by the casino which found that players who used the chart won nearly 60% of all hands, compared to just 43% for those who didn't use it.

"The basic strategy chart is a clear cheat code that gives players an unfair advantage," said resort spokesperson Sara Jenkins. "We're simply leveling the playing field by imposing this surcharge."

Both the casino and its patrons have come under fire in recent years as the rise of electronic gaming has made traditional gambling less popular. In response, the casino has tried to increase its edge in other games, such as Blackjack.

The new surcharge will go into effect on July 1st and will apply to all Blackjack tables, including those in the casino's high limit area.

#  Harveys to Add 10% Surcharge for Basic Blackjack Strategy Chart

In light of the recent news that Harveys Online Casino will be adding a 10% surcharge for any player employing basic blackjack strategy, we took it upon ourselves to investigate further.

Although this may seem like a petty move on the casino’s part, apparently their rationale is that players who use a basic chart are “cheating the casino out of money”. This couldn’t be further from the truth, as using a chart is actually a way to ensure that you make the most of your bet, and gives you the best chance possible of winning.

Indeed, blackjack is a game that relies heavily on luck, but there are ways to stack the odds in your favour. By using a chart to help you make decisions while playing, you can reduce the house edge from around 0.5% to just 0.1%. This may not seem like much, but over time it can make a big difference in your overall winnings.

Of course, if you don’t feel comfortable using a chart or just don’t have time to learn all the ins and outs of the game, there is no shame in simply playing by instinct. However, if you are looking to maximise your chances of winning then employing basic blackjack strategy is definitely the way to go.

#  Resort Casino Stateline to Impose 10% Surcharge on Basic Blackjack Strategy Chart

A new surcharge is set to take effect at the Resort Casino Stateline in Nevada come November 1st. The 10% surcharge will be added to the cost of blackjack hands that are played using a basic strategy chart, according to a notice posted at the casino.

The purpose of the surcharge is said to be aimed at players who "employ basic strategies in an attempt to gain an advantage over the house," as stated in the notice. Basic strategy is a mathematically sound approach to gambling which can reduce the house edge on certain games, including blackjack.

Casino officials say that the surcharge is needed in order to maintain the "integrity" of their games and protect their profits. However, some players feel that the surcharge is nothing more than a way for the casino to make extra money off of those who are trying to play smart.

Blackjack is one of the most popular casino games around, and many players use a basic strategy chart in order to improve their odds. With this new surcharge in place, players will now have to pay an extra 10% on top of whatever they may already be losing while playing blackjack.

Whether or not this new surcharge will have a negative impact on business at Resort Casino Stateline is yet to be seen. However, it's likely that many savvy blackjack players will choose to take their business elsewhere in light of this new development.
