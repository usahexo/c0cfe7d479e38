#  Majority of Gambling in NYS Comes from Casinos 

# October 2017

According to a recent report from the New York State Gaming Commission, the majority of gambling in the state comes from casinos. In total, casinos brought in over $10 billion in revenue in 2016. This accounted for over three-quarters of all gambling revenue in the state.

The next largest category was horse racing, which brought in just under $2 billion. Lotteries were third, with revenues of over $1.5 billion. Bingo and other small gaming operations brought in the remaining $300 million or so.

Interestingly, although casinos rake in by far the most money, they also account for the vast majority of illegal gambling activity as well. This is likely because casino games are much easier to play than traditional lottery games or bingo, and there is a greater variety of games available.

In spite of this illegality, casinos continue to be extremely popular in New York. This is due not only to the large sums of money that can be won, but also to the fact that casinos offer a fun and exciting experience that many people enjoy.

#  Slot Machines account for over 60% of Gambling Revenue 
$40 billion is wagered in casinos every year in the United States. Out of this $40 billion, over $24 billion is generated from slot machines. Slot machines account for over 60% of gambling revenue in casinos and continue to be one of the most popular casino games.

Slot machines are popular because they are easy to play and offer a chance to win big payouts. Players simply insert money into the machine, choose how many lines they want to bet on, and press spin. If the symbols on the reels match up, they win a payout. The biggest jackpots can be won by hitting the right combination of symbols on the payline.

Most slot machines have a fixed payout table that determines how much players will win based on the symbols that appear on the reels. However, there are also progressive jackpot slots that offer a chance to win millions of dollars by hitting the right combination of symbols. These slots are highly sought after because they can provide players with life-changing payouts.

Many people enjoy playing slot machines because they offer a relatively simple way to gamble and provide an opportunity to win big payouts. Slot machines are responsible for more than 60% of gambling revenue in casinos, making them one of the most popular casino games.

#  Table Games Revenue Growing in NYS 

According to recent reports, table games revenue is growing in New York State. The amount of money generated from these types of games has increased by around 12 percent in the last year alone, with a total of $2.3 billion being brought in from 2018 to 2019. This is great news for the industry as a whole and should help to encourage even more growth in the future.

There are many different factors that have contributed to this success. For one thing, table games are becoming increasingly popular with players. They offer an immersive and engaging experience that can’t be matched by traditional slot machines. Additionally, casinos are doing a better job of marketing these games and creating an excitement around them.

The increased revenue has also allowed casinos to invest more in their properties. This includes things like renovations, new gaming areas, and even employee bonuses. It’s clear that the table game industry is thriving in New York State and shows no signs of slowing down anytime soon.

#  Race & Sports Book Gambling on the Rise 

In the past, gambling on sports was seen as a taboo act. However, in recent years this perception has changed and race and sports book gambling is now seen as a mainstream form of entertainment. In fact, according to a report by the research firm Global Betting and Gaming Consultants, the global gambling market is expected to grow from $437.5 billion in 2017 to $526.8 billion by 2021. This is due in part to the rising popularity of sports betting, which is now legal in most parts of the world.

There are many factors that have contributed to the growth of race and sports book gambling. First, there has been a general relaxation of laws governing gambling over the past few decades. In addition, new technology has made it easier for people to place bets online or via mobile devices. And finally, the increasing availability of legal sports betting options has made it more socially acceptable to bet on sporting events.

Despite this growth, there are still many countries where race and sports book gambling is illegal or restricted. For example, in the United States it is only legal in four states: Delaware, Nevada, Montana, and Oregon. In contrast, in Europe there are dozens of countries where it is legal and widely available. This discrepancy is likely due to cultural differences between the two regions; in Europe gambling is seen as a more mainstream form of entertainment, while in the United States it is often viewed as sinful or immoral.

Whether you’re for or against race and sports book gambling, there’s no doubt that it’s growing into a big business. So if you’re interested in placing some bets on your favourite team or athlete, be sure to do your research first and find out where you can do so legally.

#  Illegal Gambling still a Serious Problem in NYS

Illegal gambling is a pervasive problem throughout New York State. Operators of illegal gambling businesses routinely disregard the law, harming communities and their citizens in the process. These businesses often have negative consequences for the neighborhoods where they are located, including increased crime and decreased property values.

Despite these dangers, law enforcement has been largely unsuccessful in combating illegal gambling. This is due, in part, to the inherent challenges in detecting and investigating these crimes. Nevertheless, state and local officials must continue to address this issue head-on, using all available resources to shut down these operations.

Illegal gambling can take many forms, including but not limited to:

· Traditional casino games (e.g., blackjack, roulette)

· Card games (e.g., poker)

· Sports betting

· Slot machines

· Bingo

All of these activities are strictly prohibited by New York law. However, that has not stopped unscrupulous business owners from opening up underground gaming establishments throughout the state. Many of these operations are affiliated with organized crime syndicates, which only increases the potential for criminal activity and violence.



In recent years, law enforcement has made some progress in cracking down on illegal gambling. In particular, authorities have targeted so-called "Asian social clubs," which are often used as fronts for illegal gaming activity. Nevertheless, more needs to be done to eradicate this problem once and for all. Local communities need to be vocal about the dangers of illegal gambling and state and local officials need to dedicate more resources to stopping these operations.
