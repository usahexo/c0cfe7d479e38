"This is an exciting opportunity for us," said airport board chairman Lenny Piper. "O'Henry is a first-class airport and we are looking forward to working with them."

"We are very excited about our new affiliation with the Cincinnati Reds," said O'Henry Airport Director Doug Myers. "This is great news for our airport and for the Northern Kentucky community."

#  When did O'Henry first appear in a Cincinnati Reds game?

Fans of the Cincinnati Reds eagerly awaited the appearance of O'Henry in a game. His debut was on September 10, 2018, in a game against the Washington Nationals. He entered the game as a pinch hitter in the bottom of the ninth inning and drew a walk. Although he didn't score, Reds fans were thrilled to see him make his major league debut.

#  How has O'Henry been performing for the Cincinnati Reds this season?

O'Henry has been having an excellent season for the Cincinnati Reds. He has a batting average of .305 and an on-base percentage of .359. He has also hit 16 home runs and driven in 47 runs. O'Henry's performance has been a major reason why the Reds have been one of the best teams in baseball this season.

#  What do fans think of O'Henry as the new mascot for Cincinnati Reds?

Fans of the Cincinnati Reds baseball team are divided over the team's decision to replace their traditional mascot, a cartoonish red-eyed and white-bearded man in a robe named Mr. Redlegs, with a character based on O'Henry, the renowned American short story writer. Some feel that the new mascot is inappropriate and disrespectful to a literary icon, while others say that he is cute and lovable.

Those in favor of the change argue that O'Henry is an American hero and represents Cincinnati as well as Mr. Redlegs does. They also point out that the character was created by a Reds fan and that he has been well-received by both children and adults at appearances around the city.

Opponents of the change worry that O'Henry will be too obscure for many fans to identify with and that he may not be as popular as Mr. Redlegs. They also question why the team felt it necessary to make such a drastic change after more than 100 years with Mr. Redlegs.

In the end, only time will tell if O'Henry becomes a beloved fixture among Reds fans or if he is relegated to being a footnote in team history.
