#  When will they be available?

The latest update to Apple's iPhone software, iOS 11, was released on September 19th. It had been in beta testing since June. While it included a number of new features, such as Peer-to-Peer payments and augmented reality support, one of the most eagerly anticipated additions was not included: AirPlay 2.

AirPlay 2 is a feature that allows audio streaming to multiple devices simultaneously. It was first introduced in iOS 7 in 2013, but was removed from the final release due to stability issues. With its return in iOS 11, many users were excited at the prospect of being able to share music or podcasts with friends without having to pass around an iPhone or iPad.

However, a few weeks after the release of iOS 11, Apple updated their website to remove mention of AirPlay 2. This left many people wondering whether the feature had been pulled from the final release or was still in development.

Today, almost two months after the initial release of iOS 11, there is still no word on when AirPlay 2 will be made available. Apple has not given any indication as to when it might be released and there have been no reports of it being implemented in any upcoming updates.

This has left many users frustrated, as they have been eagerly waiting for a feature that has yet to materialize. Some have even gone so far as to say that AirPlay 2 is nothing but a hoax and that Apple never intended to release it at all.

So what is going on with AirPlay 2? Is it still in development or has it been scrapped altogether? Only time will tell.
