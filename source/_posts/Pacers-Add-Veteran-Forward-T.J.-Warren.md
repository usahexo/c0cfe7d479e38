#  Pacers Add Veteran Forward T.J. Warren

The Pacers bolster their bench with the addition of veteran forward T.J. Warren from the Phoenix Suns.

Warren, who averaged 18.0 points per game last season for the Suns, gives the Pacers another scoring threat off the bench. He is a versatile player who can play both small and power forward positions.

Last season, the Pacers struggled to find consistent scoring off the bench. Warren should help address that issue. He is a good scorer and rebounder who can also shut down opposing players on defense.

Adding Warren gives the Pacers another weapon as they try to make a deep run in the playoffs this season.

#  Warren Brings Depth To Pacers' Frontcourt

Since signing with the Indiana Pacers in the offseason, Warren has been a consistent force on both ends of the floor for the team.

In 23 games this season, Warren is averaging 16.8 points and 7.2 rebounds per game. He is also shooting 49.3 percent from the field and 39.1 percent from three-point range.

The addition of Warren has given the Pacers' frontcourt much-needed depth and allowed them to maintain their top-four ranking in the East despite Victor Oladipo's absence.

Oladipo is set to return to the lineup soon and that could potentially mean less playing time for Warren, but he has shown that he can be a valuable member of the team regardless of his role.

#  Pacers Acquire Miles Bridges In Three-Team Trade

The Indiana Pacers acquired Miles Bridges from the Charlotte Hornets in a three-team trade on Wednesday.

Indiana traded Cory Joseph to the Houston Rockets and received Trevor Ariza in return. The Rockets then traded Ariza to Charlotte for Miles Bridges.

Bridges was the No. 12 pick in the 2018 NBA Draft out of Michigan State. He played one season with the Spartans, averaging 17.1 points and 7.0 rebounds per game.

The Pacers were in need of another wing player after they lost Bojan Bogdanovic to free agency this offseason. Joseph was expendable with Tyreke Evans, Aaron Holiday and Victor Oladipo all capable of playing point guard.

Bridges provides scoring and athleticism off the bench for Indiana and should be a valuable player for them this season.

#  NBA Free Agency: Pacers Bolster Frontcourt With T.J. Warren

The Indiana Pacers made a significant addition to their frontcourt on Tuesday, agreeing to terms with veteran forward T.J. Warren on a four-year, $58 million deal.

Warren is coming off the best season of his career, averaging 18.0 points and 5.1 rebounds in 32 minutes per game for the Phoenix Suns. The sharpshooting 26-year-old should be a perfect fit in Indiana’s system, which relies heavily on ball movement and player movement.

“We are extremely excited to add T.J. to our team,” said Pacers president of basketball operations Kevin Pritchard in a statement. “He is an unselfish player who fits our style of play perfectly. He has had a tremendous amount of success in his young career and we believe he will continue to thrive in our environment.”

With Warren in the fold, the Pacers now have one of the deepest and most versatile frontcourts in the NBA. Warren joins big men Myles Turner, Domantas Sabonis, Thaddeus Young and Doug McDermott on Indiana’s roster.

The move also signals a shift in philosophy for the Pacers, who are no longer content to stand pat while teams around them improve. Last season, they pulled off a shocker by signing All-Star guard Victor Oladipo away from the Oklahoma City Thunder.

Now they’ve followed that up by adding Warren, one of the most underrated players in the league. With Oladipo and Warren leading the charge, Indiana could be poised for a breakout season in 2018-19.

#  Pacers bolster frontcourt with signing of T.J. Warren

The Indiana Pacers have bolstered their frontcourt for the 2019-2020 season by signing T.J. Warren to a four-year, $58 million contract, according to ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski.

Warren is coming off of his best season in the NBA, having averaged 18.0 points and 5.1 rebounds per game while shooting 49.7% from the field and 39.3% from three-point range with the Phoenix Suns.

Pacers president of basketball operations Kevin Pritchard said of the signing: "T.J.'s breakout season makes him one of the most sought-after forwards in the league and we're excited to add him to our roster...He is a versatile scorer who can play both small and power forward, has a high basketball IQ and is a fierce competitor."

Warren was originally selected by the Suns with the 14th pick in the 2014 NBA draft out of North Carolina State University. He has career averages of 14.4 points and 4.5 rebounds per game.

The Pacers made it to the Eastern Conference Finals last season before losing to the Toronto Raptors in seven games and will be looking to Warren to help them take that next step and make it to the NBA Finals.
