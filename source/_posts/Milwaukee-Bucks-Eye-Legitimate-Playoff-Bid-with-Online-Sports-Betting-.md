#  Milwaukee Bucks Eye Legitimate Playoff Bid with Online Sports Betting 

The Milwaukee Bucks were one of the most improved teams in the NBA last season, and they are looking to take the next step this year. With Giannis Antetokounmpo leading the way, the Bucks are eyeing a legitimate playoff bid, and online sports betting fans can place a wager on them to do just that.

The Bucks finished 2017-18 with a 44-38 record, good for sixth place in the Eastern Conference. They made it all the way to the conference semifinals before getting swept by the Boston Celtics. This year, they are expected to be even better, and oddsmakers have them pegged as a contender for the Eastern Conference title.

Antetokounmpo is one of the best players in the NBA, and he is coming off a season in which he averaged 26.9 points, 10.0 rebounds and 4.8 assists per game. He is surrounded by a talented supporting cast, including Khris Middleton, Eric Bledsoe and Malcolm Brogdon, and the Bucks should be one of the most exciting teams in the league this season.

If you’re looking to place a wager on the Bucks this season, BetOnline is a great site to do so. They currently have Milwaukee listed as +1600 to win the Eastern Conference championship, which means they are third behind only Boston and Toronto. They are also listed at +4000 to win the NBA title, making them one of the top longshot bets on the board.

The Bucks are definitely an intriguing team this season, and online sports betting fans should consider placing a wager on them to make noise in the playoffs. With Antetokounmpo leading the charge, anything is possible for this team

#  Legitimate Sports Gambling Helps Milwaukee Bucks Secure Playoff Berth 

The Milwaukee Bucks secured their spot in the playoffs for the first time since 2014-15 season with a 116-92 victory over the Atlanta Hawks on Saturday night. The Bucks were aided by Khris Middleton’s 29 points and Giannis Antetokounmpo’s 24 points. The Bucks now have a 42-37 record, three games ahead of the Miami Heat for the 8th seed in the Eastern Conference.

Milwaukee’s success this season can partially be attributed to the legalization of sports gambling in Wisconsin in September 2017. Sports gambling is now legal across all forms of sports in Wisconsin, including basketball, football, baseball and hockey. This has allowed the Bucks to secure a larger percentage of the local gambling market, which has translated into more revenue and better fan support.

Prior to legalization, bettors would often place bets on out-of-state teams or illegal offshore websites. This created a black market that was difficult to control and largely benefitted criminals. With sports gambling now legal in Wisconsin, fans are much more likely to place bets on their local team. This has led to increased ticket sales and improved team performance.

It is clear that legalizing sports gambling has helped the Milwaukee Bucks secure a playoff berth. Other states should follow suit and legalize sports gambling to help their local teams and economies.

The Milwaukee Bucks were founded in 1968 and are a professional basketball team based in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. They play in the Eastern Conference of the National Basketball Association (NBA). The team is owned by Wes Edens and Marc Lasry.

The Bucks have had a lot of success over the years, but they have not won an NBA championship. They advanced to the NBA Finals in 1971, but they lost to the Baltimore Bullets. In 1974, they made it to the NBA Finals again, but they lost to the Boston Celtics. The Bucks have also won one conference championship (1971) and six division championships (1973, 1981, 1982, 1983, 1984, 2001).

There has been a lot of excitement surrounding the Milwaukee Bucks lately because of their young superstar player named Giannis Antetokounmpo. He is a 22-year-old Greek player who was born in Athens. He is 6'11" tall and weighs 222 pounds. He was drafted by the Bucks with the 15th overall pick in the 2013 NBA draft.

Giannis Antetokounmpo has quickly become one of the best players in the NBA. He averaged 22.9 points per game during the 2016-2017 season. He also averaged 8.8 rebounds per game, 5.4 assists per game, and 1.9 blocks per game. He was named to the All-Star team for the first time in 2017 and he was named MVP of that game.

James is a four-time MVP who has won three championships with the Miami Heat and one championship with the Cleveland Cavaliers. Antetokounmpo is definitely someone to watch this season!
