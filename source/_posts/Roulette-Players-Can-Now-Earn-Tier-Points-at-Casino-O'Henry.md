#  Roulette Players Can Now Earn Tier Points at Casino O'Henry

Casino O'Henry, an online casino featuring games from Betsoft and Habanero, has announced that it will now award Tier Points to players who participate in its roulette games.

Tier Points are a measure of a player's loyalty to a casino, and they can be redeemed for rewards such as cashback bonuses, free spins, and entries into prize draw contests.

"We're always looking for ways to reward our players," said Casino O'Henry spokesperson Jessica Black. "Roulette is one of our most popular games, so we thought it would be great to give players the chance to earn Tier Points while they play."

The Tier Point bonus applies to all variants of roulette offered at Casino O'Henry, including American, French, and European roulette. The bonus is awarded on a sliding scale, with players earning more points for bets that are closer to the winning number.

"We wanted to make sure that the bonus was fair for all players," said Black. "That's why we based it on the size of the bet."

In addition to the Tier Point bonus, Casino O'Henry is also offering a special promotion on its blackjack games. Until September 30th, players who bet at least $10 will receive double rewards points. These points can be exchanged for free spins, cashback bonuses, and other perks.

Casino O'Henry is licensed by the Curacao Gaming Authority and accepts payments in USD, EURO, CAD, and GBP.
