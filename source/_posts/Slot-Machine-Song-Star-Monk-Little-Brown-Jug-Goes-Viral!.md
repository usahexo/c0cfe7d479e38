#  Slot Machine Song Star Monk Little Brown Jug Goes Viral!

A lucky slot machine player at the Star Monk casino in Las Vegas has won a $1.8 million jackpot playing the Little Brown Jug game.

The unidentified player, who is originally from Taiwan, was playing the game on Monday when they hit the massive jackpot.

"It's amazing. I still can't believe it," the player told local media. "I was shaking when I saw the numbers come up."

The Little Brown Jug game is a five-reel slot machine with 20 paylines. It is based on the popular horse racing track betting game of the same name.

This isn't the first big win at Star Monk casino this year. In March, another player hit a $1 million jackpot playing a different game called Golden Lamprey.

Star Monk is one of the most popular casinos in Las Vegas, thanks to its huge range of games and generous payout rates. In addition to slots, players can also enjoy blackjack, poker, roulette and other table games.

The casino is open 24 hours a day and 365 days a year, making it perfect for those late night gaming sessions. There's even a free shuttle service that runs between Star Monk and other major casinos in Las Vegas.
