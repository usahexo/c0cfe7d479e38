<h1 id="How-did-Cincinnati-Reds-become-affiliated-with-O’Henry"><a href="#How-did-Cincinnati-Reds-become-affiliated-with-O’Henry" class="headerlink" title="How did Cincinnati Reds become affiliated with O’Henry?"></a>How did Cincinnati Reds become affiliated with O’Henry?</h1><p>The Cincinnati Reds became affiliated with O’Henry in 2014.</p>
<p>The Kenton County Airport Board, which owns and operates the airport, made the decision to affiliate with O’Henry because of the airport’s location and its proximity to Cincinnati.</p>
<p>“This is an exciting opportunity for us,” said airport board chairman Lenny Piper. “O’Henry is a first-class airport and we are looking forward to working with them.”</p>
<p>“We are very excited about our new affiliation with the Cincinnati Reds,” said O’Henry Airport Director Doug Myers. “This is great news for our airport and for the Northern Kentucky community.”</p>
<h1 id="When-did-O’Henry-first-appear-in-a-Cincinnati-Reds-game"><a href="#When-did-O’Henry-first-appear-in-a-Cincinnati-Reds-game" class="headerlink" title="When did O’Henry first appear in a Cincinnati Reds game?"></a>When did O’Henry first appear in a Cincinnati Reds game?</h1><p>Fans of the Cincinnati Reds eagerly awaited the appearance of O’Henry in a game. His debut was on September 10, 2018, in a game against the Washington Nationals. He entered the game as a pinch hitter in the bottom of the ninth inning and drew a walk. Although he didn’t score, Reds fans were thrilled to see him make his major league debut.</p>
<h1 id="How-has-O’Henry-been-performing-for-the-Cincinnati-Reds-this-season"><a href="#How-has-O’Henry-been-performing-for-the-Cincinnati-Reds-this-season" class="headerlink" title="How has O’Henry been performing for the Cincinnati Reds this season?"></a>How has O’Henry been performing for the Cincinnati Reds this season?</h1><p>O’Henry has been having an excellent season for the Cincinnati Reds. He has a batting average of .305 and an on-base percentage of .359. He has also hit 16 home runs and driven in 47 runs. O’Henry’s performance has been a major reason why the Reds have been one of the best teams in baseball this season.</p>
<h1 id="What-do-fans-think-of-O’Henry-as-the-new-mascot-for-Cincinnati-Reds"><a href="#What-do-fans-think-of-O’Henry-as-the-new-mascot-for-Cincinnati-Reds" class="headerlink" title="What do fans think of O’Henry as the new mascot for Cincinnati Reds?"></a>What do fans think of O’Henry as the new mascot for Cincinnati Reds?</h1><p>Fans of the Cincinnati Reds baseball team are divided over the team’s decision to replace their traditional mascot, a cartoonish red-eyed and white-bearded man in a robe named Mr. Redlegs, with a character based on O’Henry, the renowned American short story writer. Some feel that the new mascot is inappropriate and disrespectful to a literary icon, while others say that he is cute and lovable.</p>
<p>Those in favor of the change argue that O’Henry is an American hero and represents Cincinnati as well as Mr. Redlegs does. They also point out that the character was created by a Reds fan and that he has been well-received by both children and adults at appearances around the city.</p>
<p>Opponents of the change worry that O’Henry will be too obscure for many fans to identify with and that he may not be as popular as Mr. Redlegs. They also question why the team felt it necessary to make such a drastic change after more than 100 years with Mr. Redlegs.</p>
<p>In the end, only time will tell if O’Henry becomes a beloved fixture among Reds fans or if he is relegated to being a footnote in team history.</p>

<h1 id="When-will-they-be-available"><a href="#When-will-they-be-available" class="headerlink" title="When will they be available?"></a>When will they be available?</h1><p>The latest update to Apple’s iPhone software, iOS 11, was released on September 19th. It had been in beta testing since June. While it included a number of new features, such as Peer-to-Peer payments and augmented reality support, one of the most eagerly anticipated additions was not included: AirPlay 2.</p>
<p>AirPlay 2 is a feature that allows audio streaming to multiple devices simultaneously. It was first introduced in iOS 7 in 2013, but was removed from the final release due to stability issues. With its return in iOS 11, many users were excited at the prospect of being able to share music or podcasts with friends without having to pass around an iPhone or iPad.</p>
<p>However, a few weeks after the release of iOS 11, Apple updated their website to remove mention of AirPlay 2. This left many people wondering whether the feature had been pulled from the final release or was still in development.</p>
<p>Today, almost two months after the initial release of iOS 11, there is still no word on when AirPlay 2 will be made available. Apple has not given any indication as to when it might be released and there have been no reports of it being implemented in any upcoming updates.</p>
<p>This has left many users frustrated, as they have been eagerly waiting for a feature that has yet to materialize. Some have even gone so far as to say that AirPlay 2 is nothing but a hoax and that Apple never intended to release it at all.</p>
<p>So what is going on with AirPlay 2? Is it still in development or has it been scrapped altogether? Only time will tell.</p>
